# iOS app for API on Rails Book

After reading the book "[API on Rails](http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/)" by [Abraham Kuri Vargas](https://github.com/kurenn), I came up with the ideia of a simple iOS application to communicate with the API that was developed along the book.

#Basic Features
  - User authentication
  - JSON format
  
If you haven't read the book yet, you can clone my repository and run the API locally.
